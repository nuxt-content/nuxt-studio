::prose-note{type="info"}
AI features are optional and require a Vercel AI Gateway API key. Vercel provides $5 in free credits, which is typically sufficient for most editing scenarios over several days.
::

## Configuration

### Vercel AI Gateway Setup

Vercel AI Gateway provides a unified API for accessing AI models with built-in caching, rate limiting, and analytics.

::prose-steps{level="4"}
#### Create a Vercel Account

Sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) if you don't have an account.

#### Access AI Gateway

Navigate to your [Vercel AI Gateway Dashboard](https://vercel.com/ai-gateway) in your account settings.

#### Create an API Key

Generate a new API key from the AI Gateway dashboard.
::

### Set Environment Variable

To enable AI-powered editing in Studio, simply set the `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` environment variable.

```bash [.env]
AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY=your_vercel_ai_gateway_api_key
```

### Contextualization

You can then configure AI behavior in your `nuxt.config.ts` file to provide contextual guidance and ensure the AI output aligns with your preferred writing style.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  studio: {
    ai: {
      context: {
        title: 'My Awesome Blog',
        description: 'A technical blog about web development',
        style: 'Technical and detailed, with practical examples',
        tone: 'Professional yet approachable'
      }
    }
  }
})
```

## Features

### AI Completion

AI Completion provides intelligent text suggestions as you type in the TipTap visual editor.

#### How It Works

- **Auto-triggers** after 500ms when you stop typing
- **Manual trigger**: Press `Cmd/Ctrl+J` to request a suggestion anytime
- **Accept**: Press `Tab` to insert the suggestion
- **Dismiss**: Press `Escape` or continue typing to ignore
- Powered by **Claude Haiku 4.5** for fast responses (\~300-500ms)
- **Toggle On/Off:** Click the sparkles ✨ button in the footer toolbar to enable/disable AI completion

### AI Transform

Transform selected text with AI-powered improvements, fixes, translations, and simplifications.

#### Available Modes

- **Fix**: Correct grammar and spelling errors
- **Improve**: Enhance clarity, engagement, and readability
- **Simplify**: Use simpler words and shorter sentences
- **Translate**: Translate to another language (language input selection)

#### How it works

- **Trigger** the AI Transform tool from the content editor toolbar
- **Select** a mode from the dropdown menu
- **Review** the proposed changes in the preview pane before applying them.
- **Accept or decline** the AI proposition 
- Powered by **Claude Sonnet 4.5** for high-quality results

### Contextualization

For both completion and transform features, the AI system is contextualized and enriched to deliver more accurate and relevant suggestions:

- **Context-aware :** The system considers surrounding content and cursor position to provide intelligent recommendations.
- **MDC Component**: The AI provides context-aware assistance tailored to specific component types, including component names, slot configurations, and structural patterns.

## Experimental Collection Context

::note
This feature is under development and may change in future releases.
::

Once enable , you can access the AI Tab by clicking the AI icon in the top navigation bar of Nuxt Studio. The AI Tab allows you to generate and manage AI writing style guides per collection, giving AI deeper context about your content structure.

### What It Does

- **Analyzes Collections**: Examines your content collections to understand structure and style
- **Generates Style Guides**: Creates comprehensive writing guidelines for each collection
- **Contextualizes AI**: Uses collection-specific context for better AI suggestions

### How to Enable

To enable AI-powered style guide generation, you need to configure your Nuxt project with the experimental feature flag and then activate the AI features in Studio.

```js [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  studio: {
    ai: {
      experimental: {
        collectionContext: true  // Enable AI Tab
      }
    }
  }
})
```

### How It Works

1. **Access**: Click the AI tab button in the Studio interface
2. **Select Collection**: Choose a collection to analyze
3. **Generate Context**: Click "Analyze Collection" to create a style guide
4. **Edit Context**: Review and customize the generated guidelines
5. **AI Uses Context**: Future AI operations will reference these guidelines

### Context Files

Context files are stored in the `.studio` folder as `${collectionName}.md` files. These files are automatically loaded during AI operations to provide collection-specific guidance.
